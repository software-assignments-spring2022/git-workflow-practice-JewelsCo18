# Metaverse
*By Brian Chen, NYTimes* 

In this article written by Brian Chen, he talks about the origins of the term "metaverse". It was interesting to know that the term "metaverse" and "meta" was not something that Mark Zuckerberg coined but an idea of the convergence of virtual reality and a second, digital life. According to Matthew Ball, a venture capitalist focused on the metaverse, he states
> "It’s moving into what people call ambient computing. It’s about being within the computer rather than accessing the computer. It’s about being always online rather than always having access to an online world."

At the moment, we already have some sense of the metaverse with social aspects of videogames such as Fornite; but, technologists believe that the experience can be even greater. Therefore, companies such as Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft are making strides towards a digial lifestyle by creating more software and hardware pieces such as the Hololens and Playstation VR.

Interesting article! It seems like there is a large misconception about how far back the origins of most things in tech strech. While things always seems new, it's incredible just how long they've been worked on for. -Duardo
